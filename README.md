# DFIR-SQL-Query-Repo
Collection of SQL queries templates for digital forensics use by platform and application.
These queries are templates that should be edited based on the needs of the analyst. 
Many of these queries will have an accompanying README with a link for more detailed explanations on usage and possible caveats.  

The 'Axiom - Custom Artifact' excel spreadsheet will list all the apps in the repo that have artifact extraction support in the Magnet Forensics tool. These XML files can be found in the Custom Artifacts exchange webpage located here:
